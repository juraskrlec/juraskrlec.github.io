Hi, welcome to my site! 
My name is Jura, and I am currently a Staff Engineer at [Microblink](https://microblink.com), specializing in iOS. My work focuses on the SDKs and R&D. 

At Microblink, we have developed some fascinating things in the Computer Vision area. Yes, of course, we use Machine Learning :) 

On this site, I will focus on the framework side of iOS development, write some tips and tricks, and see where we can go from there. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me! Have a great day!
